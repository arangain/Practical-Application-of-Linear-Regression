**Predicting Restaurant Profits from City Populations**

Overview:
- Exploration of simple linear regression to predict the profitability of restaurant locations based on city populations.
- This project demonstrates how to build, train, and apply a linear regression model from scratch.
- This guide is aimed at helping the CEO of a restaurant franchise to make data-driven decisions on where to expand their business.


Objectives:
- Implement linear regression to understand the relationship between city populations and restaurant profits.
- Use gradient descent to optimize the regression parameters.
- Predict potential profits for new restaurant locations in different cities.
Features
- Loading and visualizing dataset using Matplotlib.
- Computing the cost function to evaluate regression models.
- Implementing gradient descent to optimize model parameters.
- Making predictions using the trained model.

Dataset:
_The dataset consists of:_
x_train: Population of various cities (in tens of thousands).
y_train: Corresponding monthly profit from restaurants in those cities (in tens of thousands of dollars).

Visualizations:
- Scatter plots of initial data points (Profits vs. Population).
- The linear regression fit to the data.
- Plots showing the convergence of the cost function during training.
